# Career Sense Multiple Access
Link layer protocol used in ethernet


- __Carrier Sensing__ - refers to listening before transmitting(wait for the other person to finish talking before you start to talk)
    - So a node listens to the channel(carrier) before transmitting
    - If there is transmission the node waits until there is no transmission for a certain amount of time and then begins transmitting

- __Collision Detection__ - if someone else begins talking, stop talking
