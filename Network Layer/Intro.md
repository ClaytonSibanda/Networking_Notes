__Routing vs Forwarding__

Routing - involves all network's routers to determine path to be taken from source to destination(makes use  routing algorithms)
Forwarding - involves transfer of a packet from an incoming link to an appropriate output link within a single router.

Routing Analogy- travelling from Cape Town to Joburg. We can think of routing as the process of planning the journey before starting the journey.
Forwarding Analogy - we can think of Forwarding as a car taking an interchange to take another road.

Every router has a Forwarding table used to choose the best path.
Routers use a field in the packets to determine the output link
Routing algorithm determine numbers inserted into the Forwarding table
Routers are network layer switches
